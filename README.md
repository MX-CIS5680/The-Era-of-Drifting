## Description
"The Era of Drifting" is a high-octane action platformer game that offers a unique twist to
the genre. Set in an expansive world where friction is a mere concept, players are
challenged to master the art of momentum and acceleration. To survive in the
treacherous cold, you are forced to pursue the Bonfires.

## Core Mechanism
The core mechanic of The Era of Drifting revolves around the kinetic dance of pushing
ice blocks and performing wall-bounce-and-jump to achieve the necessary speed to
traverse otherwise impassable areas. The ice blocks might lie dormant, waiting for the
player's touch to awaken their potential. It is a game that demands precision and agility,
as players must learn to seamlessly push the ice, bounce off walls, and glide across
chasms with a thrilling sense of speed.

## Tutorials (White Ghost system)
The "White Ghost" system in our game is designed to assist beginners by playing back pre-recorded player behaviors. This feature is particularly helpful for new players who are learning how to play the game and can provide valuable guidance on optimal strategies and movements.

## Experimental Features
In the "TimeRewind" branch, there is an experimental feature that allows players to time rewind to the last checkpoint. This feature can be played in the Unreal Engine editor, preferably in "standalone mode," but it cannot be packaged due to its reliance on the "UnrealEd" module.

### How to Use the Time Rewind Feature
1. Make sure you are in the [TimeRewind](https://github.com/MX-CIS5680/The-Era-of-Drifting/tree/TimeRewind) branch.
2. Compile the source code and launch the project.
4. Play the game in the *Standalone Game* Mode.
5. In the gameplay, display the console, and enter `DisableAllScreenMessages` to hide on-screen messages (optional)

### Important Notes:
- This feature is still in the testing phase and may not be fully optimized.
- The "TimeRewind" feature is designed to enhance gameplay experience by allowing players to rewind to the last checkpoint.
- Feedback and suggestions for improvement are highly encouraged.

### Known Limitations:
- The feature is best experienced in *Standalone Game* mode.
- Due to its reliance on the "UnrealEd" module, it **cannot be packaged for distribution**.
